9. **A company has just deployed a new web application / Server. They want to ensure they are proactively addressing potential security risks. Which phase of the VMDR lifecycle should they prioritize first?**  
    **c) Asset Discovery**

10. **Which of these characters is commonly used to separate commands in a command injection attack?**  
    **c) ;**

11. **If a port responds with a SYN-ACK packet during a SYN scan, it indicates that the port is open.**  
    **a) True**

12. **A vulnerability scan finds a vulnerability in a system that is behind multiple layers of firewalls (IP: 192.168.1.80) and a vulnerability in a system that is directly exposed to the internet (IP: 203.0.113.40). Which should be prioritized?**

13. **A company uses a cloud storage service with weak access controls. The potential for sensitive data to be exposed due to these weak controls is a:**  
    **d) Risk**

14. **Which of the following best describes a "true positive" in security testing?**

19. **A single computer floods a web server with connection requests, overwhelming its resources and causing it to crash. This is an example of a:**  
    **b) Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack**

20. **A penetration tester is using tools like Nmap and Nessus to discover open ports and vulnerabilities in a web server. Which phase are they in?**  
    **c) Vulnerability Analysis**

21. **What is the main risk associated with "Insecure Direct Object References" (IDOR)?**  
    **a) Unauthorized access to data by manipulating object references.**

22. **What is the key difference between a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (choose the best answer)?**  
    **b) Vulnerability assessments identify weaknesses, while penetration testing attempts to exploit them.**
