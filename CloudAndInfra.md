### Cloud and Infra

### **1. Cloud Security Fundamentals (Azure)**
   - **Shared Responsibility Model**: Understand what security responsibilities lie with the cloud provider vs. the customer.
   - **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**: Role-based access control (RBAC), least privilege principle.
   - **Data Protection**: Encryption (at rest & in transit), key management in Azure Key Vault.
   - **Networking in Cloud**: Virtual Networks (VNets), Network Security Groups (NSG), and Private Endpoints.
   - **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Tools like Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor cloud security risks.

### **2. Firewall & Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Palo Alto)**
   - **Traditional Firewalls vs. Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFWs)**: Deep Packet Inspection, Application Layer Filtering.
   - **WAF Protection**: Defends against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks.
   - **Zero Trust Policy**: Implementing least privilege access and segmentation.

### **3. Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS) (Zscaler SASE)**
   - **Difference between IDS & IPS**: IDS detects threats, IPS blocks them.
   - **Anomaly-Based vs. Signature-Based Detection**: How threats are identified.
   - **SASE (Secure Access Service Edge)**: Merging network security with cloud-delivered services.

### **4. Proxy, VPN & Secure Access (Zscaler)**
   - **VPN vs. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)**: VPNs create private tunnels; ZTNA authenticates users dynamically.
   - **Secure Web Gateway (SWG)**: Filters internet traffic to prevent malicious sites.
   - **Cloud Proxy Services**: How Zscaler inspects encrypted traffic to prevent threats.

### **5. Endpoint & Email Security (Microsoft Defender XDR)**
   - **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**: Behavioral analytics and automated response.
   - **Phishing & Business Email Compromise (BEC) Defense**: AI-based email filtering, DKIM, SPF, DMARC.
   - **Malware Sandboxing**: Isolating suspicious files before execution.

### **6. Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) & Security Operations Center (SOC) (Splunk)**
   - **SIEM vs. SOC**: SIEM aggregates logs; SOC actively monitors & responds.
   - **Threat Intelligence & Correlation**: Using SIEM rules to detect anomalies.
   - **Incident Response Playbooks**: Standard procedures for security events.

### **7. Cloud Computing in Business Scenarios**
   - **Understanding Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Cloud Security**.
   - **Compliance & Regulations**: GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2.
   - **Real-World Attacks**: Case studies of cloud breaches and lessons learned.
